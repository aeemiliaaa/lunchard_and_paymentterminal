🍽️ LunchCard & PaymentTerminal

A simple Python project simulating a prepaid lunch card system—users can load money and buy meals.  
This is an **expanded version** of an earlier LunchCard implementation, introducing a `PaymentTerminal` that handles both card and cash transactions.

Built as part of the MOOC 2025 Python Programming course on [mooc.fi](https://www.mooc.fi).
